Table Schema

t1_user_active_min.csv
This table contains active minutes data logged after experiment started.
Each row represents the total number of minutes spent on site for each user on a date.
If a user never visited the site for a given date, there wouldn't be data for that uid on that date.
- uid: user ID
- dt: date when corresponding active minutes are registered
- active_mins: number of minutes spent on site for the date

t2_user_variant.csv
This table contains users’ treatment assignment.
Each row represents the assignment information for a unique user.
- uid: user ID
- variant_number: the experiment variant user is in. 0 for control, 1 for treatment
- dt: date when user entered the experiment, should be ‘2019-02-06’ for all users
- signup_date: the date string that user signed up on
  
t3_user_active_min_pre.csv
This table contains active minutes data before the experiment started.
It has a similar format as t1, except the dt range can extend before the experiment start date.
- uid: user ID

- active_mins: number of minutes spent on site for the date

t4_user_attributes.csv
This table contains data about some user attributes.

Suppose you are a Data Scientist on the Mobile team at Quora. The team has just introduced a new UI design to the Quora app. The goal of the new design is to increase user engagement (measured by minutes spent on site). The team ran an A/B test to evaluate the change. Using the data, help the team understand the impact of the UI change better.

Aside from this new UI design, our mobile team is looking into improving retention of app users. In other words, we hope that users who have started using the app come back often to continue using our app. Assuming you have access to all our data, what data analyses would you do to shape product strategies in this area?

List 3 ideas, please a) be as specific as possible - clearly define the metrics you want to look at, such that following your prescription, a data scientist on the team can produce the same numbers; b) explain how you will generate insights from the data. As an example of a specific analysis idea (for a different analysis purpose): "I will look at the total number of answers written in the last month, breaking down by country. If the data shows X, this means Y and I would recommend Z as our strategy."
